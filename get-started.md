title: "Getting Started"

Our group has a main network folder assigned named `airpollution`. All the contents of the different projects should be stored and organized in this shared folder as defined in the [Network Folders](network-folders.md) page.

Most projects involve data analyses which should be developed following the framework set in the sections:

* [Project Structure](project-structure.md)

* [Reproducible Research](reproducible-research.md)

* [Style Guide](style-guide.md)

Note that data subject to confidentiality agreements should never leave the institutional network folders. This ensures the data is safe from external threats as well as reducing the risk of data loss since the folders are backed up every week. Moreover if all the files are always in these network folders, it is easy to share your work with other members of the group.

## Sharing data

When data needs to be shared with people outside of ISGlobal, use the institutional Nextcloud server called [Namek](https://namek.isglobal.org) for medium sized data. Do not store sensitive data in your Google Drive.

## Requirements

* User account

* ISGlobal email address account

* Fortinet VPN client for remote access

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

Note that your user account is different from your ISGlobal Gmail account and will have different credentials.

:::

The VPN is only necessary if you will be accessing the ISGlobal network (i.e. Intranet, network folders) remotely. This includes being connected to Campus Mar's WiFi. If you have been assigned an institutional laptop/desktop you can connect to the ISGlobal network through Ethernet cable at Campus Mar, in which case no VPN connection is needed.

## Remote Access

When working remotely through the VPN, some operations such as opening files or reading/writing data from/to the network folders will be slower, as the VPN will limit the bandwidth speed.

## Getting Access

IT must grant you access before you can connect the network folder. If you do not have access already, contact IT by openning an incidence in the [Intranet site](https://isg-intranet.isglobal.org/) or sending an email to `sri.tic@isglobal.org`. When you do, ask them how you can permanently mount the `airpollution` network folder in your machine's file system.
